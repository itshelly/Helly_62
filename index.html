    <h1> GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control, helping 
        developers store, manage, and collaborate on code. Projects are organized in 
        repositories where changes can be tracked using commits and branches. It allows
        teams to review code with pull requests, report issues, and manage updates. 
        GitHub is widely used in both open-source and professional development, with 
        support for automation and integration with other tools.
